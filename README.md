# Virtual-Assistant-
This project is a voice-controlled virtual assistant built in Python that works similarly to popular AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant.
It listens to your spoken commands, processes them, and performs various tasks such as playing YouTube videos, telling the current time and date, fetching quick facts from Wikipedia, and even cracking jokes.

The assistant uses SpeechRecognition to capture and understand your voice, and pyttsx3 to respond with realistic speech output.
It can be activated by a wake word (in this case, “Alexa”) followed by a command.
With simple voice interaction, you can enjoy hands-free control over everyday information and entertainment tasks.

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple Python libraries to create an interactive, real-time, AI-like experience on your computer — perfect for learning speech-to-text, text-to-speech, API usage, and automation in Python.
